# FOOGLE üçîüëÅ ‚Äî Food Image Classification

## Overview

FOOGLE is an AI-powered food image classifier built with EfficientNetB2 and the Food-101 dataset. It predicts 101 food categories from photos, providing accurate, real-time results. The Gradio web UI makes FOOGLE easy to use and demo.

## Features

- üçï Classifies food images into **101 types** (Food-101 dataset)
- üß† EfficientNetB2 model with transfer learning
- ‚ö° Real-time predictions and confidence scores
- üåê Gradio web interface (browser-based)
- üöÄ Ready for deployment on Hugging Face Spaces

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rageya/food-vision.git
cd food-vision

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app locally
python app.py
```

## Usage

1. Upload or capture a food image on the Gradio web UI
2. Click **Predict** to see the food category and confidence score
3. Try example images or test your own food photos

## Model Details

- **Architecture:** EfficientNetB2
- **Dataset:** Food-101 (101,000 images, 101 categories)
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, Gradio
- **Deployment:** Hugging Face Spaces or local server
